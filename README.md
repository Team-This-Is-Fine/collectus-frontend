## User Stories

### MVP Goals

* As a user, I would like to make a new collection and be able to add collectibles to it so that I can categorize my collectibles to better organize them.
* As a user, I would like to view, edit, and delete a collection so that I can maintain an accurate and organized system for my collectibles.
* As a user, I would like to view and delete items so that I can organize my collectible items individually.

### Stretch Goals

* As a user, I would like to see a better design so that my collections can appear as valuable as they are to me.
* As a user, I would like to be able to edit my collectibles so that I can maintain the accuracy of my collections.
* As a user, I would like to have user authentication and authorization so that my collections/collectibles aren't accessible to everyone.
* As a user, I would like to be able to see other users collections/collectibles so that I can find like-minded collectors.

## Approach Taken

For the development of this app, we had a group of four and about 3.5 days to finish. We wanted to try a few different approaches that would allow us to work efficiently while still challenging us to be better developers. To include:

* Pair programming - for the first half of the project, we split into pairs - one focusing on front-end, the other focusing on back-end.

* Mob programming - when faced with difficult bugs or problems, we would consolidate into one group to solve the problem. This was the primary approach during the second half of the project timeeline.

* Tokens - we set rules for using tokens in order to mitigate excessive usage. If you can't solve something by yourself after about 15 min, get a partner to solve it. If two people can't solve it after 15 min, we all consolidate and try to figure it out with all four members. If it still is too difficult, we would use a token to get help.

* Work hours - there was never anything established for coding outside of class time (0900-1700).
